<a id="call-for-talksposters" class="anchor" href="#call-for-talksposters" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Call for Talks/Posters</h3>

Abstracts for considerations should be 300 – 600 words and submitted from following system:
<br>
<a href =“test”>The Easy Chair site for PRIVAGEN 2015</a>.
<br>
<br>
The abstracts submitted before July 1 are reviewed by the program committee and a few of them will be selected as oral presentations. All the submitted abstracts will be considered for oral presentations unless the author specify their submission is for poster presentation only.
The abstracts submitted after June 30 (late abstracts) will not be considered for oral presentations. 
</p>
<p>
The notification whether each abstract is presented as a talk or a poster will be announced around July 20.
</p>
<p>
PRIVAGEN accepts both unpublished and published works, and the submissions of unpublished works are not considered as publication.
</p>

<a id="topics-of-interest" class="anchor" href="#topics-of-interest" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Topics Of Interest</h3>

<p>Topics of interest include, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Privacy-preserving machine learning and data mining for genomics</li>
<li>Cryptographic techniques that potentially assist genomic sequence retrieval/medical information analyses/epi-genomic information analyses</li>
<li>Genome ethics</li>
<li>Privacy evaluation of personal genome</li>
<li>Genome-hacking</li>
</ul>
  
<h3>
<a id="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h3>

<p>Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology allow us to obtain large-scale genomic data very efficiently, which is driving a boom in genomic research. Especially, personal genome analysis is gathering a lot of attention because it has a great potential to accelerate progress in biology and medical science.
</p> 

<p>Despite the high expectations, however, we cannot fully utilize such existing rich genomic resources at present due to many restrictions caused by privacy issues, and it is an emerging problem to develop efficient methods to handle personal genome data without compromising privacy.
</p>

<p>The main motivation for organizing the workshop is to facilitate a deep discussion among researchers from various fields such as bioinformatics, machine learning, data mining, cryptography, ethics, etc, which we believe is very important to tackle the challenging problem.
